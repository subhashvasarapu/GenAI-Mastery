# ⚖️ Bias and Fairness in Generative AI

Generative AI models learn from vast datasets collected from the internet and human sources. These datasets often contain **biases** — leading to **unfair, inaccurate, or harmful outputs**.

Understanding and mitigating these biases is essential for building **trustworthy and ethical AI systems**.

## 🎯 What Is Bias in AI?

Bias refers to a model producing **skewed or unfair results** due to imbalanced, prejudiced, or unrepresentative training data.

### 🔍 Example:
- A resume screening model favors male names over female ones.
- An image generator shows only men when asked for “CEO” prompts.
- A language model associates certain races with negative traits.

## 🔍 Types of Bias

| Bias Type        | Description                                         | Example                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Representation Bias** | Some groups are underrepresented in training data | Non-western cultures rarely shown in results |
| **Stereotyping Bias**   | Reinforces harmful stereotypes                 | Women shown only as nurses, not doctors     |
| **Confirmation Bias**   | Reflects the most common internet opinion       | Reinforces echo chambers in conversations   |
| **Toxicity Bias**       | Outputs offensive or aggressive content         | Auto-generating hate speech                 |

## 🧪 Techniques for Mitigation

### ✅ 1. Dataset Balancing
- Ensure diverse, inclusive training data.
- Example: Equal gender and racial representation in image/text datasets.

### ✅ 2. Prompt Auditing
- Manually check how the model responds to sensitive prompts.
- Test edge cases and adversarial questions.

### ✅ 3. Output Filtering
- Apply filters or moderation tools to block harmful outputs.
- Use models like OpenAI’s moderation endpoint or custom classifiers.

### ✅ 4. Differential Privacy
- Mask individual data contributions to prevent privacy leaks and bias amplification.

### ✅ 5. Feedback Loops
- Allow users to report biased or inappropriate outputs for retraining or correction.

# Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering

## Fine-Tuning:
Involves re-training a pre-trained model on domain-specific data.
- More resource-intensive
- Offers better customization

## Prompt Engineering:
Crafting inputs to guide the LLM toward desired outputs.
- Fast and flexible
- Requires creativity in prompt design

## Example:
Prompt: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points"
Output: • Point 1 • Point 2 • Point 3

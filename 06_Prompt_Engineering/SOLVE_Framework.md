# 🧠 SOLVE Framework for Designing Better AI Prompts

The **SOLVE framework** helps you structure prompts to get **clear, relevant, and actionable** output from GenAI models like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot.

## ✅ What is the SOLVE Framework?

| Letter | Meaning        | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| S      | **Specify the task** | Clearly define what you want the AI to do |
| O      | **Outline the context** | Provide necessary background or data |
| L      | **Limit the response** | Set format, length, or focus |
| V      | **Validate expectations** | Clarify quality/tone or expected style |
| E      | **Elicit response** | Ask the AI to produce the final output |

## 🧪 Example 1: Creating a Bodybuilding Meal Plan

### ✏️ Raw Prompt (unstructured)
> “Give me a bodybuilding meal plan.”

### 🧠 Prompt Using SOLVE:
```

S – I want a high-protein bodybuilding meal plan to support muscle growth.
O – I work out 5 times a week, I’m vegetarian, and need 3000 calories per day.
L – Limit the response to a 1-day plan: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
V – Make it realistic, affordable, and easy to prepare using Indian ingredients.
E – Write the final plan in bullet points with clear meal names and calories.

```

Final Prompt:
> “Create a 1-day vegetarian bodybuilding meal plan with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks totaling 3000 calories. I work out 5 times/week and prefer Indian ingredients. Make the meals realistic and easy to cook. Present in bullet points with meal names and calories.”

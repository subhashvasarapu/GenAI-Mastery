# 🧩 Prompt Types in Generative AI

Prompting is how we guide large language models (LLMs) to produce relevant, structured, and useful output. Understanding different **types of prompts** helps tailor responses based on your goal — whether it's creative writing, problem-solving, explanation, or simulation.

---

## 1️⃣ Instruction-Based Prompts

> Direct commands that tell the model exactly what to do.

### ✅ Structure:
```

\[Action] + \[Content or Topic]

````

### 💡 Example:
```text
Summarize the following paragraph in two sentences.
````

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Summarization
* Formatting tasks
* Translating or rewriting content

---

## 2️⃣ Question-Answer Prompts

> Ask the model a **question**, and expect a clear, concise answer.

### 💡 Examples:

```text
What is the capital of Argentina?

Why does the sun appear red during sunset?
```

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Factual lookup
* Trivia or quiz generation
* Curiosity-based learning

---

## 3️⃣ Roleplay Prompts

> Assign a **persona or role** to the AI to simulate expertise or context.

### ✅ Structure:

```
You are a [role]. [Task]
```

### 💡 Examples:

```text
You are a career coach. Help me prepare for a software engineering interview.

Act as a motivational speaker and inspire me to start my fitness journey.
```

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Simulated conversations
* Personalized feedback
* Domain-specific responses

---

## 4️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompts

> Encourage the model to **think through problems step by step** to arrive at the correct solution.

### ✅ Trigger Phrase:

```
Let’s think step by step.
```

### 💡 Example:

```text
If a train travels 60 km in 2 hours and then 90 km in 3 hours, what is the average speed? Let's think step by step.
```

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Math problems
* Logical reasoning
* Multi-step analysis

# 🎧 AudioGen & Whisper – Audio Generation and Transcription with AI

Generative AI is not just for images and text—it's also transforming the way we work with **sound**. Two standout models in this space are:

- 🔊 **AudioGen** – For generating sound/audio
- 🗣️ **Whisper** – For transcribing speech to text

---

## 🔊 1. AudioGen – Audio Generation

> **AudioGen** is a model developed by Meta AI that generates **audio from text prompts**.

### 🧠 What It Does
- Converts written descriptions into **realistic sound effects**.
- Trained on audio datasets like AudioSet and internal datasets.
- Can generate:
  - Animal sounds
  - Nature ambience
  - Mechanical noise
  - Human non-speech sounds (like clapping, footsteps)

### ✅ Example Prompts
```text
- "A dog barking near a lake"
- "Applause in a concert hall"
- "Rain hitting a metal roof"
````

### 🔍 Use Cases

| Field            | Example Use Case                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Game Design      | Generate SFX for environments               |
| Film / Animation | Sound design without needing raw recordings |
| Accessibility    | Create auditory cues for blind users        |

## 🗣️ 2. Whisper – Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

> **Whisper** is a speech-to-text model developed by OpenAI that transcribes **audio into written text**.

### 🧠 What It Does

* Recognizes and transcribes speech from **audio files**.
* Supports **\~100 languages** and performs **language detection**.
* Can even **translate** non-English audio to English.

### 🔍 Features

| Multilingual     | Transcribes in many languages        |
| Robust Accuracy  | Handles background noise and accents |
| Translation Mode | Auto-translates audio to English     |
| Timestamp Output | Returns timestamps for subtitles     |

### ✅ Example Usage (Code)

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = model.transcribe("speech.mp3")
print(result["text"])
```

### ✅ Use Cases

| Domain           | Application                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Education        | Transcribe lectures or podcasts     |

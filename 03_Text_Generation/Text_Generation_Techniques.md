# 📝 Text Generation Techniques in NLP

Text generation is the task of automatically creating human-like text using AI models. These techniques range from basic rule-based systems to advanced neural architectures like GPT and T5.

## 🧠 Categories of Text Generation Techniques

### 1. 🔧 Rule-Based Generation
- **Description**: Uses templates, grammar rules, and dictionaries.
- **Example**:  
  - Template: `Today is [DAY] and the weather is [WEATHER].`  
  - Output: `Today is Monday and the weather is sunny.`
- ✅ Pros: Interpretable, fast  
- ❌ Cons: Rigid, not scalable

---

### 2. 📊 Statistical Language Models (N-grams)
- **Description**: Predicts next word based on probabilities from previous n words.
- **Example**: `The cat sat on the ___` → `mat` (most likely bigram/trigram)
- ✅ Pros: Simple, data-driven  
- ❌ Cons: Struggles with long-term dependencies

---

### 3. 🧠 Neural Language Models (RNN, LSTM)
- **Description**: Uses neural networks to model sequences of text.
- **Advantages**:
  - Understands context better than n-grams
  - Can generate variable-length output
- ✅ Pros: Handles longer contexts  
- ❌ Cons: Training takes time, can forget earlier inputs

---

### 4. ⚙️ Transformer-Based Models
#### a. GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)
- **Auto-regressive** model: predicts the next word token by token
- Example Prompt: `Write a poem about spring...`
- Applications: Chatbots, Email drafting, Content creation

#### b. BERT? ❌
- Not suitable for generation (uses masked language modeling)

#### c. T5 / FLAN-T5 / UL2
- **Text-to-text** format: Converts every NLP task into a generation problem
- Example:  
  Input: `Translate English to French: How are you?`  
  Output: `Comment allez-vous ?`

### 5. 🔄 Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
- Learns a distribution of text and samples from it.
- Better for diverse sentence generation than RNNs.
- ✅ Useful in creative writing and story generation

---

### 6. 🤖 GANs for Text (TextGAN, SeqGAN)
- Generator vs Discriminator framework.
- Trains models to fool a discriminator into believing generated text is real.
- ⚠️ Harder to train due to text being discrete data.

## 🧪 Sampling Strategies

| Strategy        | Description                               | Use Case Example                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Greedy Search  | Picks the highest probability token        | Quick but often dull responses         |
| Beam Search    | Explores multiple top paths in parallel    | Translation, summarization             |
| Top-k Sampling | Limits sampling to top k probable tokens   | Balanced creativity and control        |
| Top-p (nucleus)| Chooses from tokens until p probability mass is covered | More natural generation         |
| Temperature    | Controls randomness; higher = more creative| Poetry, creative writing               |

| Technique Type     | Best For                            | Limitation                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Rule-Based         | Structured templates, alerts        | Limited flexibility                     |
| N-gram             | Small-scale generation tasks         | No long-term context                    |
| RNN/LSTM           | Paragraph generation                 | Vanishing gradient, forgetting          |
| GPT                | Conversational AI, content creation  | Needs large compute                     |
| T5/UL2             | Multi-task generation (QA, summar.)  | Slower inference                        |
| VAE / GANs         | Creative, diverse outputs            | Training instability, low control       |

## ✨ Bonus: Prompting Tips for Text Generation

```text
Prompt: “Explain AI in simple words like I'm 5 years old.”
→ Output: “AI is like a robot brain that learns things just like you do!”

Prompt: “Write an email to my boss saying I’ll be late due to traffic.”
→ Output: “Hi [Boss Name], I’m running late due to traffic. I’ll reach by 10 AM. Apologies for the delay.”

Prompt: “Give me 3 tweet-sized tips about productivity.”
→ Output: “1. Break tasks into small parts 🧩 2. Time block your day ⏰ 3. Rest is productive too 😴”
